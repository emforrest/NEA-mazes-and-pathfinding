# NEA-mazes-and-pathfinding
## My Computer Science Non-Examined Assessment in 2021-2022, based on digital mazes and pathfinding algorithms

During the end of year 12 and most of year 13, as part of my Computer Science A-level I undertook the NEA project coursework. My project was written in Python using the tkinter library for its interface, and consisted of two major components - generating a maze that the user could play, and solving mazes created by the user using the A* pathfinding algorithm. I created a game-like system that allowed a user to create an account and record their fastest times completing three different difficulties of mazes. In the A* Simulation section the user could place walls into a grid, as well as a start, target and two kinds of obstacle, and watch how the algorithm calculated the shortest path through it, with informational panels to explain the process further.

I wrote a very detailed report on all aspects of this project, including analysis, design, documentation, testing and evaluation. This repository contains the report (which I reccommend reading) as well as my source code for the project.

I ended up getting 69/75 for this coursework, which helped me to achieve an A* grade overall in Computer Science.
